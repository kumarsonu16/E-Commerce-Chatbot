If you ask out of context(knowledge context that's stored in astraDb) then will not get answer

E.g. 
Question: what is a capital of india?
Ans: This question is unrelated to the provided product information. I cannot answer it.

So in this case you have to handle this use case by adding the logic in you routes.

Now context based:
Question: what is best ear buds?
Ans: You will get answer from chatbot because question is related to the context.
Question: can you give me a details about one plus buds?
Ans: Yes, you will get it from chatbot
